# Product Strategy

## Vision
Sharp Timer is the definitive minimalist productivity tool for macOS users who value focus and simplicity. It seamlessly integrates into the menu bar, providing powerful time management capabilities without the visual clutter of traditional desktop applications.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Distraction-Free**: Lives exclusively in the menu bar, keeping the dock and desktop clean.
- **Effortless Workflow**: One-click access to start, pause, or switch timer modes.
- **Health-Conscious**: Built-in modes for eye relief and long breaks encourage healthy work habits.
- **Native Experience**: Feels like a built-in part of macOS, respecting system conventions and aesthetics.

## User Personas
- **The Deep Worker**: Needs to track 25-minute Pomodoro sessions without app switching distractions.
- **The Developer**: Wants a timer that sits quietly next to their system stats, accessible via keyboard or quick click.
- **The Health-Aware Professional**: Needs reminders to look away from the screen every 20 minutes to prevent eye strain.

## Key Features
1.  **Three-Mode System**:
    -   **Work**: Standard focus block (default 25 min).
    -   **Rest Your Eyes**: Short break for vision health (default 2 min).
    -   **Long Rest**: Extended break to recharge (default 15 min).
2.  **Smart Persistence**:
    -   Saves timer state on app quit.
    -   Remembers custom durations per mode.
    -   Restores context immediately on relaunch.
3.  **Audio & Notifications**:
    -   Custom, pleasant alarm sounds.
    -   Native macOS notifications for background alerts.
    -   Graceful fallbacks if audio is disabled.
4.  **Safety Mechanisms**:
    -   Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (quitting, switching modes).
    -   Prevents accidental loss of active timer progress.

## Success Metrics
-   **Retention**: Users keep the app running in their menu bar throughout the workday.
